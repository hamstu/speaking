# Public Speaking
> A repository of my talk proposals; in progress, accepted or rejected

In the spirit of transparency and OSS. I'm keeping all my talk proposals here in this repository. **I've never given a talk at a conference before** so this is all very new to me! I'm excited to dive in. *Want me to speak about something here?* Please hit me up on twitter; I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/hamstu">@hamstu</a>.

‚ú® Inspired by my friend and coworker [Joe Birch's PublicSpeaking repository](https://github.com/hitherejoe/PublicSpeaking).

### What's up with the old Japanese art?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa">The Great Wave off Kanagawa</a> has to be one of my favorite peices of art. I somehow find it both peaceful and exciting at the same time ‚Äî kind of like the way I feel about speaking at conferences!
