**Title**: Building a Blockchain

**Length**: 25 mins

**Description**:
It seems like everyone and their aunt is talking about cryptocurrency these days. I mean, you can't even browse Twitter without seeing tweets about the hottest new coin or ICO. And similarly, every other startup is now built on some kind of fancy 'chain of blocks'. Like, what is this? Minecraft? Well, be confused no more! In this talk, you'll learn exactly what a 'blockchain' is. How? By actually building one! In JavaScript! And what's more, we'll also build a real cryptocurrency â€” confCoin â€” on top of that blockchain.

**Abstract**:
_Coming soon..._
